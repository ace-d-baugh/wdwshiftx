    <h2>Facebook Sucks!</h2>
    <h3 class="clr-secondary">Facebook was not designed for posting shifts.</h3>
    <p>
      Facebook was designed to connect people and facilitate social interactions
      by creating a platform where users can share updates, photos, and videos,
      engage with friends and family, join communities, and discover new content
      and experiences. That's nice and all, but not what you need.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <h3 class="clr-secondary">Ask yourself these questions:</h3>
      <li>Have you had to wait to join your area's Facebook group?</li>
      <li>Have you posted a shift only to have it buried by other posts?</li>
      <li>Have you had to repost/bump your shift because it was buried?</li>
      <li>
        Have you gone to find a shift, but found many old and out-of-date
        shifts?
      </li>
      <li>Have you had to scroll through irrelevant posts to find a shift?</li>
      <li>
        Have you had to call out because someone couldn't find your shift?
      </li>
